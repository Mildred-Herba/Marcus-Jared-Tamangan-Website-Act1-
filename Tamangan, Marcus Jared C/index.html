        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Section 1.Short Title and Scope - This Act shall be known as the “Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006.” It shall cover the different stages involving children at risk and children in conflict with the law from prevention to rehabilitation and reintegration.</li>
           
            <li>Section 2. Declaration of State Policy - The following State policies shall be observed at all times:

 The State recognizes the vital role of children and youth in nation building and shall promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual and social well-being. It shall inculcate in the youth patriotism and nationalism, and encourage their involvement in public and civic affairs.</li>
          
            <li>Section 3. Liberal Construction of this Act – In case of doubt, the interpretation of any of the provisions of this Act, including its implementing rules and regulations (IRRs), shall be construed liberally in favor of the child in conflict with the law.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Republic Act 10630, signed into law in 2013 in the Philippines, primarily aims to strengthen the Commission on Audit (COA) and enhance its institutional capacity. The COA is tasked with auditing government agencies to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.

Implementation involves increased budget allocation for COA, hiring more personnel, and improving their skills and technology infrastructure. The impact is seen in heightened scrutiny of government expenditures, leading to improved financial management, reduced corruption risks, and increased public confidence in the government.

This law has positive effects across sectors as it promotes good governance, fiscal responsibility, and effective resource utilization. The increased transparency benefits areas like education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social services, ensuring funds are allocated efficiently to address the country's needs.</p>
